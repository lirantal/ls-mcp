# Credential Detection Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the credential detection feature for MCP server configurations, as requested in [Issue #71](https://github.com/lirantal/ls-mcp/issues/71).

## Feature Description

The feature detects environment variables in MCP server configurations that might contain credentials and displays them in the CLI output with appropriate risk level indicators.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Credential Detection Service (`src/services/credential-detection-service.ts`)

- **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns organized by risk level to identify potential credential environment variables
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes credentials into high and low risk levels for simplicity
- **Value Masking**: Masks sensitive values for display (shows first and last character with asterisks)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Detects API keys, tokens, passwords, organization IDs, and service-specific patterns

#### Pattern Organization

The credential patterns are organized by risk level for easier maintenance:

**High Risk Patterns** (API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets):
- `API_KEY`, `api_key`, `API-KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
- `API_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `PASSWORD`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- `CREDENTIAL`, `CREDS`
- Database passwords: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- Cloud services: AWS, Azure, GCP credentials

**Low Risk Patterns** (Organization IDs, account identifiers):
- `ORG_ID`, `ORGANIZATION_ID`, `ACCOUNT_ID`, `USER_ID`
- `OPENAI_ORG_ID`

### 2. Type System Updates (`src/types/mcp-config-service.types.ts`)

- Added `CredentialVariable` interface for individual credential variables
- Added `CredentialAnalysisResult` interface for credential analysis results
- Updated `MCPServerInfo` interface to include credential information
- **Note**: `MCPServerConfig` contains only pure configuration data from files, while `MCPServerInfo` contains our app's enriched metadata including credentials

### 3. MCP Config Parser Integration (`src/services/mcp-config-parser.ts`)

- Parses MCP server configurations into `MCPServerConfig` objects (pure config data)
- **No longer adds credentials** - this is handled during conversion to `MCPServerInfo`
- Maintains clean separation between raw config and app analysis

### 4. Render Service Updates (`src/services/render-service.ts`)

- Added new `CREDENTIALS` column to the MCP servers table
- Integrated `CredentialWarningComponent` for displaying credential warnings
- Maintains table formatting and alignment

### 5. Credential Warning Component (`src/components/credential-warning.ts`)

- **Risk Level Indicators**: 
  - üî¥ HIGH RISK (red) - API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets
  - üîµ LOW RISK (blue) - Organization IDs, account identifiers
- **Summary Display**: Shows count of credential variables and their names
- **Value Masking**: Displays masked values for security

## Type System Architecture

The refactored system now has a clean separation of concerns:

- **`MCPServerConfig`**: Pure configuration data from MCP config files
  - Contains: `name`, `command`, `args`, `transport`, `type`, `env`
  - **No credentials** - this is raw config data

- **`MCPServerInfo`**: Enriched metadata for our application
  - Contains: All config data + `source`, `status`, `credentials`
  - **Credentials are added here** during conversion from config to info

This architecture ensures that:
1. Configuration parsing remains pure and focused
2. Credential analysis happens at the right layer (app logic)
3. Types clearly represent their purpose
4. The system is more maintainable and semantically correct

## Usage Example

When an MCP server configuration includes environment variables with credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "transport": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "12345"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI will display:

```
STATUS  NAME           SOURCE  TRANSPORT  CREDENTIALS
  ‚óè     firecrawl-mcp  npx     stdio      üî¥ HIGH RISK (1 cred vars: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=1***5)
```

## Security Features

1. **Value Masking**: Sensitive values are masked to prevent exposure
2. **Risk Assessment**: Credentials are categorized by risk level (high/low)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Uses comprehensive patterns organized by risk level
4. **Non-intrusive**: Only displays warnings, doesn't block or modify configurations

## Pattern Maintenance

The new structure makes it easy to add or modify credential patterns:

```typescript
private static readonly CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS = {
  high: [
    // Add new high-risk patterns here
    /new[_-]?secret[_-]?pattern/i,
  ],
  low: [
    // Add new low-risk patterns here
    /new[_-]?id[_-]?pattern/i,
  ]
}
```

This organization eliminates the need to modify conditional logic when adding new patterns - simply add them to the appropriate risk level array.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for the credential detection service
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests with MCP config parser
- **Test Fixtures**: Updated test fixtures to include credential scenarios
- **Coverage**: All new functionality is thoroughly tested

## Benefits

1. **Security Awareness**: Users can identify potential credential exposure in their MCP configurations
2. **Risk Assessment**: Clear indication of credential risk levels (high/low)
3. **Compliance**: Helps with security audits and compliance requirements
4. **Developer Experience**: Non-intrusive warnings that don't break existing workflows
5. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new credential patterns without code changes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Patterns**: Allow users to define custom credential patterns
2. **Configuration Options**: Configurable risk thresholds and display options
3. **Export Reports**: Generate credential audit reports
4. **Integration**: Hook into security scanning tools and CI/CD pipelines

## Files Modified

- `src/services/credential-detection-service.ts` (new)
- `src/types/mcp-config-service.types.ts`
- `src/services/mcp-config-parser.ts`
- `src/services/mcp-config-service.ts`
- `src/services/render-service.ts`
- `src/components/credential-warning.ts` (new)
- `__tests__/credential-detection-service.test.ts` (new)
- `__tests__/credential-detection-integration.test.ts` (new)
- `__tests__/__fixtures__/mcp-config-service/claude-mcpServers.json`

## Conclusion

The credential detection feature has been successfully implemented and provides a comprehensive solution for identifying potential credential exposure in MCP server configurations. The feature is secure, non-intrusive, and provides clear visual indicators of credential risks while maintaining the existing functionality of the ls-mcp tool.

The new pattern organization structure makes the code more maintainable and easier to extend with new credential patterns in the future.
